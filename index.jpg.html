        <p>This space is born from love, devotion, and an eternal bond. It is dedicated to my sweet, blissful, strong-minded, and deeply artistic daughter, Martha — eternally in our hearts, eternally unattainable, eternally 8 years old. She left behind a world of inspiration which lives on in every piece I create.</p>
        <img src="sunflower.jpg" alt="Sunflower" class="image-right">
        <p>Her sense of color, shape, and beauty ran deep. Her drawings, her crafts, her playful eye — all were inimitable. Yet I dare and try, with her spirit in mind.</p>
        <img src="peach.jpg" alt="Peach" class="image-left">
        <p>From Christmas trees in every shape and form, to vibrant flowers, to cute animals with playful details — her legacy radiates in every handmade piece that now takes shape.</p>
        <img src="rainbow.jpg" alt="Rainbow" class="image-right">
        <p>It's not about perfection — it's about warmth, connection, and the charm of simplicity. A space that speaks to those who carry inside the joy of a child's eye and heart.</p>

        <p>My hope is that these creations brighten your home and soul. That they connect you with the child you once were — that they bring back laughter, memories, and a feeling of closeness and wonder.</p>
