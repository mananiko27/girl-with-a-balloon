      <p>This space is born from love, devotion, and an eternal bond. It is dedicated to my sweet, blissful, strong-minded, and deeply artistic daughter, Martha — eternally 8 years old. She left behind a world of inspiration which lives on in every piece I create.</p>
      <p><img src="sunflower.jpg" class="text-img" />Her sense of color, shape, and beauty ran deep. Her drawings, her crafts, her playful eye – all were inimitable. Yet I dare and try, with her spirit in mind.<img src="rainbow.jpg" class="text-img" /></p>
      <p><img src="peach.jpg" class="text-img" />This space isn’t about perfection. It’s about imagination, joy and simple forms that radiate warmth, color and comfort. It’s a little handmade world, simple and sincere, that speaks to anyone who still carries that childlike sense of wonder.<img src="picasso.jpg" class="text-img" /></p>
      <p><img src="branch.jpg" class="text-img" />Every piece in mARTa is crafted with care, heart, and a spark of childhood magic. From Christmas trees in every shape and form, to vibrant flowers, to playful abstractions — these creations are lively, heartfelt, and full of emotions.</p>
