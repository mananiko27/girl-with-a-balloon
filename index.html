      <p>This space is born from love, devotion, and an eternal bond. It is dedicated to my sweet, blissful, strong-minded, and deeply artistic daughter, <strong>Martha</strong> — eternally in our hearts, eternally unattainable, eternally 8 years old. She left behind a world of inspiration which lives on in every piece I create.</p>

    <p>Her sense of color, shape, and beauty ran deep. Her drawings, her crafts, her playful eye — all were inimitable. Yet, with her spirit in mind, I dare and try.</p>
    <p>Every piece in mARTa is crafted with care, heart, and a spark of childhood magic. From Christmas trees in every shape and form, to vibrant flowers, to playful abstractions—these creations are lively, heartfelt, and full of emotions.</p>
    <p>My hope is to create decorations that evoke new sensations, yet take you back – to joy, to memories, to that carefree feeling. I hope what you find here can enlighten and enrich your eyesight, bring warmth to your heart and rekindle memories.</p>
