        This space is born from love, devotion, and an eternal bond.
        It is dedicated to my sweet, blissful, strong-minded, and deeply artistic daughter, Martha — eternally in our hearts, eternally unattainable, eternally 8 years old.
        She left behind a world of inspiration which lives on in every piece I create.

        Her sense of color, shape, and beauty ran deep.
        Her drawings, her crafts, her playful eye – all were inimitable. Yet I dare and try, with her spirit in mind.

        From Christmas trees in every shape and form, to vibrant flowers, to cute animals with playful details — her legacy radiates in every handmade piece that now takes shape.

        It’s not about perfection — it’s about warmth, connection, and the charm of simplicity.
        A space that speaks to those who carry inside the joy of a child’s eye and heart.

        My hope is that these creations brighten your home and soul. That they connect you with the child you once were — that they bring back laughter, memories, and a feeling of closeness and magic.
