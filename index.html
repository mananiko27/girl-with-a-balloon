                <p>This space is born from love, devotion, and an eternal bond. It is dedicated to my sweet, blissful, strong-minded, and deeply artistic daughter, Martha — eternally 8 years old. She left behind a world of inspiration which lives on in every piece I create.</p>
                <p>Her sense of color, shape, and beauty ran deep. Her drawings, her crafts, her playful eye – all were inimitable. Yet I dare and try, with her spirit in mind.</p>
                <p>This space isn’t about perfection. It’s about imagination, joy and simple forms that radiate warmth, color and comfort. It’s a little handmade world, simple and sincere, that speaks to anyone who still carries that childlike sense of wonder.</p>
                <p>My hope is to create decorations that evoke new sensations, yet take you back – to joy, to memories, to that carefree feeling. I hope what you find here can enlighten and enrich your eyesight, bring warmth to your heart, and inspire your spirit.</p>
