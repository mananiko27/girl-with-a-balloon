        <p>This space is born from love, devotion, and an eternal bond. It is dedicated to my sweet, blissful, strong-minded, and deeply artistic daughter, <strong>Martha</strong> — eternally in our hearts, eternally unattainable, eternally 8 years old. She left behind a world of inspiration which lives on in every piece I create.</p>

        <p>Her sense of color, shape, and beauty ran deep. Her drawings, her crafts, her playful eye — all were inimitable. Yet, with her spirit in mind, I dare and try.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <img src="rainbow.jpg" alt="Rainbow painting">
        <p>This space isn’t about perfection. It’s about imagination, joy and simple forms that radiate warmth, color and comfort. It’s a little handmade world, simple and sincere, that speaks to anyone who still carries that childlike sense of wonder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section even">

        <p>Every piece in mARTa is crafted with care, heart and a spark of childhood magic. From Christmas trees in every shape and form, to vibrant flowers, to cute animals with playful details — her legacy radiates in every handmade piece that now takes shape.</p>
